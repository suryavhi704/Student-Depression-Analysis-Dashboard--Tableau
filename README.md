# 📊 Student Depression Data Analysis using Tableau & SQL

# 🔹 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing the Student Depression Dataset to understand the structure of depression and its contributing factors. Using SQL for data cleaning and transformation, and Tableau Desktop & Tableau Cloud for visualization, the goal was to uncover patterns related to financial stress, academic pressure, sleep duration, study satisfaction, and study hours.

# 📝 Problem Statement

Mental health among students is a growing concern globally. Institutions often lack clear insights into the factors contributing to depression such as academic load, financial stress, or lifestyle habits (like sleep duration and study hours). The aim of this analysis is to identify these patterns and provide meaningful insights for better student support and intervention strategies.

# ❓ Business Questions

How does financial stress impact student well-being?

What is the relationship between academic pressure and student count reporting stress?

Does sleep duration correlate with depression indicators among students?

How satisfied are students with their study schedules?

Are there noticeable patterns in study hours that influence depression levels?

# 📈 Dashboard Highlights

Financial Stress vs Student Count – Breakdown of students reporting various levels of financial stress.

Academic Pressure Analysis – Distribution of students under different levels of academic stress.

Sleep Duration Impact – Student count comparison across sleep ranges (less than 5 hours, 5–6 hours, 7–8 hours).

Study Satisfaction Levels – Bar chart showing satisfaction distribution across students.

Study Hours & Student Count – Correlation between hours studied and student well-being.

# 🔑 Key Insights

✔️ Students with less than 5 hours of sleep (123 students) show high risk of depression.
✔️ Academic pressure level AC_3 has the maximum count (125 students), highlighting it as a critical stress factor.
✔️ Most students study between 6–10 hours, but higher study hours don’t always translate to satisfaction.
✔️ Study satisfaction level 4 is the highest among students (116), but lower satisfaction levels also have significant counts.
✔️ Financial stress is evenly distributed, but FS_1 and FS_2 levels cover the majority of students.

# 🏁 Conclusion

This analysis reveals that sleep duration, academic pressure, and financial stress are the top factors influencing depression among students. Institutions can use these findings to design better support systems, like stress management workshops, academic counseling, and lifestyle awareness programs.
